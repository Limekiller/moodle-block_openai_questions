# moodle-block_openai_questions
### Generate Moodle questions automatically from text

This plugin allows a teacher to submit a paragraph of text and automatically generate Moodle questions based on the text, using OpenAI's GPT.

- Supports multiple question types; choose between creating True/False, Short Answer, and Multiple Choice questions
- Specify number of questions to generate from the text
- Review and edit questions before adding them to the question bank

## How to use

- In a given course, add the "Open AI Questions" block to the course
- Click the link in the block to generate questions
- Paste in the source text in the textbox, select the question type, and how many questions you want to generate
- Once the questions are generated, you can edit the questions and answers before saving, and -- for multiple choice questions -- select which answer should be marked as correct

Questions are always added to the top category in the course at the moment.
